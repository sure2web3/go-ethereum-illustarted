2. Configure Golang-related tools in vscode.
```bash
gopls is the language server of Go, responsible for functions such as code navigation and auto-completion. 

If it is not installed or the version is too old, it may cause the jump function to fail. 
 
Check and install gopls: 
1. Open the command panel of VS Code (Shortcut key: Cmd+Shift+P). 
2. Enter and select "Go: Install/Update Tools". 
3. In the pop-up list of tools, make sure to check gopls and then click "OK". 
4. Wait for the installation to be completed.
